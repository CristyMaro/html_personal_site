  <h3>Resources</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The "em" element represents stress emphasis of its contents</li>
    <li>The "i" element represents text that is set off from the normal prose,s
      such a foreign word, fictional character thoughts, or when the text refers
      to the definition of a word instead of representing its semantic meaning.</li>
    <li>An <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em">example</a> for "em" could be: "Just do it already!", or: "We had to do something about it".
      A person or software reading the text would pronounce the words in italics with an emphasis,
      using verbal stress.</li>
    <li>An <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/i">example</a> for "i" could be: "The Queen Mary sailed last night".
      Here, there is no added emphasis or importance on the word "Queen Mary".</li>
